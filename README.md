# Password-Generator

# Description
We were asked to create a password generator website that included a generator button, criteria for the password(Password Length, Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers and Symbols) and for it to display the password in the text box on screen.
## Issues
The primary issue for this project was making the final character set. I initially did seperate for loops for each password criteria but that was way too long and didnt work. I ended up using if statements to add 4 different character sets into one(depending if they were true or false) and using that final character set to produce the password.
## Website Features
A working password generator. When the button is pressed, you will be asked for the criteria for the password. Once the criteria is given, it will produce a password based on given criteria.
